# Application Context

Smarter Kit is a Laravel starter kit with a handful of pre-configured features and tools to help build applications.

## Development Guidelines

- When implementing any new functionality that would affect the project's installation process, update the readme to reflect the new steps
- Never include comments in the code unless absolutely necessary. If you feel like you need to add a comment, consider if the code can be refactored to be more readable instead
- Mimic the code style of the existing project, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns
- Focus on creating code that provides an excellent developer experience (DX), good autocompletion, type safety, and comprehensive docblocks
